        <h2>Learn the Basics</h2>
        <p>Basketball is played between two teams of five players each.</p>
        <p>The ball is tossed in the air to start the game. One of the players deflects it to a teammate. It is dribbled
            and passed among the teammates to protect the ball and to make a goal. The basket or the hoop is placed
            horizontally at the height of 10 feet on a back board. Each team tries to protect the goal on their side
            while trying to make a goal on the opponent's side of the court.

            The opposite team tries to get the ball, take control of it while bouncing and tries to grab it while it is
            passed among the team mates to prevent a goal. When a player commits a foul, the other team gets a chance of
            free throw or to inbound the ball. Each goal carries two points and each free throw one point. The team with
            higher score wins the game. Players may be substituted when a substitute asks for it.

            The game starts when the referee throws a jump ball. In the international sport, each game is divided into
            four 10 minute periods. However, if there's a tie between the teams they play for an extra period of 5
            minutes.

            After the first period and after the third period, the players take a 2 minute break. After the second
            period the players take a 15 minute break and exchange baskets. After a break, the last player holding the
            ball throws the ball in and starts the next period.

            The play time may also be increased if a foul is committed just before the time ticks off. In such cases a
            free throw is granted despite the time lapse.

            If a player throws the ball before the time lapses, but the ball flies down the basket after the timer ticks
            off, the goal is still considered. For more on how to play, check out the below link:</p>
